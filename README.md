If you'd like to test out the current firmware on your own hardware, there are 2 github actions scripts for the Touch Panel firmware and the Protocol Translator firmware

The 6 Touch Panel firmware builds correspond to which position you want the Touch Panel to be in (1 being top, 6 being bottom)

The 4 Protocol Translator firmware builds correspond to if the translator is controlling the left or right of the controller and if you want to mirror Touch Panel 1's inputs to all 6 Touch Panels
